      <p><strong>Hello everyone!</strong></p>
      <p><i>My name is Nurul Izzati, I grew up in Kuala Lumpur. I have 4 siblings and I am the first child. In my spare time I like to go out with my friends to go for cafe hunting around Kuala Lumpur and Selangor. However, there are times when I prefer to relax at home while spending time with my family. Recently, I finished my high school education at SMK Bukit Bandaraya in Bangsar. In addition, I have also obtained quite excellent results during high school. In addition, I have also worked at several FnB to gain more experience while waiting for spm results and Diploma admissions. I have worked as a barista, waiter, cashier and even a promoter. This helped me a lot in improving my social skills. Next, I continued my studies towards a diploma certificate at UITM Rembau in the Information Management course. Now, this semester is my last semester, there are many things I learned while studying at Rembau intentionally or unintentionally. Hopefully, I can finish my diploma at Uitm with excellent results.</i> </p>
      
      <p><i> Cheers to many more adventures time ahead! ðŸ¥‚</i></p>
